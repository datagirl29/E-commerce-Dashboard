# Tableau Project-ShoppingBag
This repository contains the analysis and visualizations I have created in Tableau.

##### About
GlobalShoppingBag is a data set which has around 50000 values. Its a customer centric data set , which has the data of all the orders that have been placed through different vendors and markets , starting from the year 2011 till 2015.

##### Project Details
The GlobalShoppingBag consist of many attributes like sales, profit, product category, dates, cost, shipping details and many more.
The project is an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding that highlights relationships and  patterns in a data set.I have cleaned the data in R language.I looked at how each factor(Sales, Profit, Time, Cost, Area, Shipping details) help in understanding overall business of Global store. Most of the relationships tells how sales and profit are affecting other factors.

##### Design Decisions
I first sifted through the dataset and roughly thought about which variables I was interested in exploring and which were outside the domain of my exploration. I first planned to look over sales and profit that global store made in these four years.
I wanted my Tableau story to have a purpose, to show to those who are interested in the facts about the store market understanding. My focus was to find out which are the major factor assist the business in making profit for the Store.
