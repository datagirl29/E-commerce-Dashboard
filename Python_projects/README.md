# Python_project - Nobel Prize History

### Introduction

 The Nobel Prize , is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances.
    The will of the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel established the five Nobel prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.The Nobel Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature, medicine, physics, chemistry, economics and activism for peace.
    A person or organization awarded the Nobel Prize is called Nobel Laureate. The word "laureate" refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honor.

### Content

This dataset includes a record for every individual or organization that was awarded the Nobel Prize since 1901.

### Project Details

I have looked over some basic questions which helped me in the data analysis process.Like,Which country has won the most prizes in each category? What words are most frequently written in the prize motivation? Can you predict the age, gender, and nationality of next year's Nobel laureates? Nobel Prize by Country/Category/Sex?

### Design Decisions

I first shifted through the dataset and roughly thought about which variables I was interested in exploring and which were outside the domain of my exploration. I planned to look over the columns of the data.Then I decided to work on individual columns and there relationship with others.
For data analysis and interactive, exploratory computing and data visualization, Python has some strong bundle of libraries like pandas,Numpy,Seaborn and Matlabplot for data manipulation tasks and many more.
